# taxtest_dotnet

install the following packages:
"Microsoft.Playwright"
"Microsoft.Playwright.Nunit"
"NUnit"
"NUnit3TestAdapter"
"System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData"

Run the test with"dotnet test --settings:chromium.runsettings"

Thanks for the possibility to work with .NET again, I really enjoyed it. It improved a lot with Playwright, now if I would need to choose Playwright between Typescript or .NET, that would be not so obvious as it was 1 year ago. :)
